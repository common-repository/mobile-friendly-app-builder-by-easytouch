Yes, it's true. The Web is dead. It's not that people aren't using The Internet anymore—they certainly are—it's just that users are moving away from the browser-based "Web" environment and into the mobile app-centric world.

Two quick illustrations: 1) Instagram has long been a true force in the social sphere, but it was years before it had a Web-based interface. Its entire model was mobile-based—the website was secondary. 2) Over the past years, we here at PCMag have even found it increasingly difficult to bring together our annual Top 100 Websites feature. Back in the early 'aughts, it was a sinch. Today, it's a stretch. (Good thing we have so many other great app roundups).

Mobile Content is a mobile detection plugin with a twist. Rather than displaying a particular theme to mobile visitors, it allows you to wrap content inside device specific shortcodes. This lets you specify certain content to desktop users, and other content for tablet users and mobile users. The plugin also lets you display content depending on a user’s operating system or device e.g. kindle or HTC phone. Mobile Content - Mobile Detection WordPress Pluginmobile app Mobile Content is a flexible plugin that lets you control exactly what is displayed to your visitors. I like many of these plugins for different reasons. I love HandHeld for its child theme support, Mobile App Plugin for its ease of use and number of options, and WP Smart Mobile and Obox Mobile for their designs. I would also consider  if I ran a high traffic blog that could financially justify the cost of the service. I hope you found this list of mobile plugins for WordPress useful. If so, I encourage you to subscribe to Elegant Themes for free updates on our latest blog posts and news. As always, I recommend doing your own research before choosing a plugin so that you select one that matches your website’s style and needs.

What are Web Apps?

At the other end of the scale are mobile-optimised web apps.

If you�ve ever seen the �mobile version� of a site, that�s what we�re talking about. An �app� like this loads within a mobile browser, like Safari or Chrome, like every other website. Your audience doesn�t have to install a web app. They don�t need to have available space on their devices.

Web apps are sometimes designed to look and behave like apps and are in general ideal when the purpose is simply to make content or functionality available on mobile, but an app is either not a good fit or too expensive.

Web apps use JavaScript, CSS, HTML5 or other languages. A developer won�t have access to a standardised SDK. Developing a web app can be simple and quick, however, their simplicity is also their downside.

There are web app �evangelists� out there that are adamant that web apps are equal to, or even better than native apps. They argue flexibility in terms of cost and functionality. There is no dependence on having a certain type of hardware either.

Web apps are limited in what they can do effectively in terms of features and they will generally always require an Internet connection to work. They are slower and less intuitive. Web apps are designed once for every platform and therefore won�t look or behave like a real app on any of them.

If you use a web app, be warned that they are also more difficult to build a loyal user-base from. Unless the reader saves it as a bookmark, users won�t have the app�s icon on their home screen as a constant reminder. As a developer or publisher, you can�t send them notifications to bring them back to your content. It�s difficult to engage with your audience.

Furthermore, with a web app, you�re missing out on an important source of downloads/traffic. Whilst native and hybrid apps appear on the App Store and Google Play, web apps won�t. With millions of searches every day on these stores, the potential to get your app discovered is real.

It�s not all negative though. This article works hard to dispel the mind-set that web apps are the �poor cousin� of native apps.

There are examples of great web apps out there. Top Design Mag have compiled a collection.

What are Hybrid Apps?

Somewhere between native and web apps you�ll find hybrid apps. They are usually quicker to build (and thus cheaper) than native apps, but a step-up from what you can expect out of browser-based web apps. Is the hybrid app the best of both worlds?

The bulk of the app is built using cross-compatible web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS and Javascript � the same languages used to write web apps. Some native code is used however to allow the app to access the wider functionality of the device and produce a more refined user experience. For native apps, instead only native code is used. The advantage of this approach is obvious: only a portion of native code has to be re-written to make the app work on the different kinds of devices available.

An advantage that hybrid apps have over native is that it�s faster and easier to develop. It�s also easier to maintain and you can change platforms. The app itself will not be as fast as a native app as it still depends on the browser speed.

There are two main players in the world of hybrid apps: Phonegap/Cordova and Appcelerator Titanium. With these tools you create HTML/CSS/Javascript local files, design and build the app as if it was a website, then use Cordova to wrap them into a mobile app.

Getting your hybrid app to run appropriately on each platform generally takes substantial work. In some situations, the total cost might become comparable to that of fully native apps, rendering the cost benefits negligible. It all depends on how close you want to get to the �native user experience� or how simple your app is.

Still, there�s one big advantage in hybrid apps. Being built on one single base, you can add functionality and have multiple versions of the app all benefit from it. On the contrary, with native apps, for every new functionality you want to introduce, the feature will have to be replicated on each platform.

There�s a big caveat here: if you�re building an app for an existing site or you have a mobile web app ready that does exactly what your app should do, but only misses what a native app generally provides (app store presence, push notifications, home screen icon, offline use), then turning your site or web app into a native app can be both quick and economical.

Not only you won�t have to manage two platforms (iOS/Android) separately, you�ll have a single web app to manage that covers the mobile web and the two major mobile platforms with your apps. This is what we built our latest  Canvas platform for!
